# Caster Plate
Plate to stabilize caster.   Personal project; I had a cabinet whose caster mounts were failing because
they were screwed into wood that was too soft, so the off-axis force from the casters was causing them to tilt.
These plates are designed to fit around the nuts of the casters and distribute the load over a greater surface area.
